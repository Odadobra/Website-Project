# Restaurant-locator

## Description 
This is a collaborative project work for weeks 9 and 10 of our course. The application allows you to search for a city and shows restaurants in the city with all they have to offer. It also includes pictures, type of cuisine, address. When you click your preferred restaurant, it also shows more information, including if it's opened or not, as well as the posibility to book by linking you to their website page.
